# Olark Observer

This project is attempting to create a monkeypatch for the Olark chat console, that will allow a user to capture events related to new/unread messages and operator status.

You can find the bookmarklet [on this page][bookmarklet].

It is planned to post these events to a server, which relays updates to an embedded system. End result - a big flashing LED when I have unread chat messages!
